question: What is the recommended use of a "multisig" wallet?
answer: For large amounts and corporate use
wrong_answers:
  - For small amounts and personal use
  - For medium amounts and non-profit use
  - For daily expenses and individual use
explanation: >-
  A "multisig" wallet is recommended for large amounts and corporate use
  because it requires multiple signatures to perform a transaction. This adds an extra
  layer of security, as it means that a single person cannot perform a transaction
  without the approval of others.
